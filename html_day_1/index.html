            Where I live and where I'm from
        </h3>
        <p>
            I currently live in the Buckhead area of Atlanta, Georiga. I grew up in Kansas City, Kansas. I lived in the Kansas City area for almost 25 years. I've always lived on the Kansas side of the metro area, but the Missouri side of Kansas City is larger and more well-known. Atlanta is the first city I have lived in that wasn't part of Kansas City. I am very excited to live somewhere new. Atlanta is a beautiful city with tons of opportunity and I'm happy to be here.

            What I'm doing
        </h3>
        <p>
            I'm studing to become a full-stack web developer. I want to learn the ins and outs of the building blocks of the web. I'm attending an excellent bootcamp in Atlanta called DigitalCrafts. This bootcamp is providing me with the tools to become successful in this field of technology. I'm excited to learn more and more with languages, frameworks, and design. There's always more to learn, and that is a big reason I enjoy this field so much!

            What I like to do
        </h3>
        <p>
            I love anything to do with technology. I like to build and set up computers in my free time. I also play lots of video games when I get the time. I like to play modern stuff, but I am also a fan of retrogaming. Systems like the Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64 are my favorites. When I'm not spending my time around technology, I like to explore the outdoors. I'm always excited to go adventuring.
